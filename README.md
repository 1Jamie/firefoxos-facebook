# firefoxos-facebook
web app project aimed to integrate facebook into the ui via push notificatons for notifications, messages and other facebook parts

the plan for the app is to use all of facebooks APIs and using them to interact with eachother. The will have to be assembled to either match facebooks current setup or maybe a chance to make a new unique ui.

may or may not after completion make a sister app for messaging specificly like on the other mobile platforms
