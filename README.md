# firefoxos-facebook
web app project aimed to integrate facebook into the ui via push notificatons for notifications, messages and other facebook parts

this is intened to be a app or script, probably going to be a web app.
The outlook of this app is to set it up to create an app or script for facebook to make it easier to access and check for the user by making it more integrated via push notifications.

plan to use some of the code from https://github.com/facebookarchive/firefox-toolbar if some of it can be retro fitted and re-purposesed if possible.

may or may not after completion make a sister app for messaging specificly like on the other mobile platforms

This is going to be my first app in general so help will be greatly appriciated

going to base it around the setup of boilerplate app probably unless someone can give a better idea
