# firefoxos-facebook
web app project aimed to integrate facebook into the ui via push notificatons for notifications, messages and other facebook parts

the site is being pulled into the app via a iframe, in turn pulling the whole website html. The notification is triggered by an eventlistener pointed at the span elements for the messages and notifications.
The outlook of this app is to set it up to create an app or script for facebook to make it easier to access and check for the user by making it more integrated via push notifications.

may or may not after completion make a sister app for messaging specificly like on the other mobile platforms

This is going to be my first app in general so help will be greatly appriciated
